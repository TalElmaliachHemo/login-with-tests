## About the tests
So to create my small reference for tests, I chosed to implement it on a page that simulates a website login page. 
I built tests for the login page, user service, user action and user reducer files.

I used jest amazing gifts, such as render, screen and user event in order to simulate a real DOM and user actions, and to see if it is indeed follow my expectations.

```
Open the terminal and enter the following line to run it locally on your computer:
```
npm i
npm start 
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser (it is supposed to happen automatically).
